# Sentiment-analysis-using-NLP
This project performs sentiment analysis on real-world airline customer reviews using an open dataset retrieved from Kaggle. The dataset contains reviews of ten major airlines, including attributes such as:

1. reviews: textual customer feedback
2. overall rating: rating on a scale from 1 to 10 
3. verified: indicates if the review was posted by a verified user
4. airline: airline associated with the review

The project explores natural language processing techniques to classify the sentiment of each review. The datasetâ€™s diversity in sentiment and language style makes it well-suited for building robust sentiment classification models.
